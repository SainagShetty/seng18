# Review2  

## Early lifecycle project planning:

1.    What are drawbacks of early requirement addressing?
2.    Define and distinguish unit, integration, system and integration tsting.
3.    Boehm reports a certain shape in the cost-estimation uncertainty curve as a project moves from initial planning to final delivery
    - Draw that shape
     - Why does the  shape change as the development continues?
4. According to Brook's Law, why does adding more programmers to a late project make taht project later?
5.  What is the delay issue effect? 
     - Make a case that it must be a fundamental problem in SE.
     - Recent empirical results challenge the delay issue effect, describe those results.

## Process planning:

0.    Draw the v-diagram.

       - What is the commit partition?
       - What is a spiral model of software development?

13. COCOMO is a parametric effort estimation methods:
      - What are the for "P" of the COCOMO attributes? Give one example of each "P"
      - In COCOMO co-effecients are shown above, what is `acap` ? What happens to project development effort when it is increased? Why?
      - In COCOMO co-effecients are shown above, what is `cplx` ? What happens to project development effort when it is increased? Why?
      - From the above parameters, find how much faster a fully distributed system compared to a fully
centralized site. If needed, you may assume that the system has 100,000 lines of code.
14. "Planning poker" is strategy is suitable for group discussion effort estimation environment
    - Describe this approach plus one advantage and one disadvantage of using this method.
15. What is no estimate method? When might it be s necessary?
16.    Case base reasoning is called a non-parametric method.
      - Why? Hint: your answer will have to describe how it works
      - Give  2 advantages and disadvantages of CBR.
      - Given the following project data, what estimate would case-based reasoning assign to the last row? Note that the words
        in t

|analyst capability|multi-site development |use of tools| product complexity| khours(estimate)|
|--|-|-|--|---|
|5   | 1|    5   | 1|    100|
|1   | 5 |   5  |  5 |   800|
|3  |  3  |  3 |   3  |  500|
|2 |   5   | 3|    5   | ?|

17. How much data do we need before we can learn good models?
18. Why is it misleading to just report the middle value of the results generated by a data miner?
19. How can we make plans about our projects when the uncertainty in the estimates is so large?
20. What are the different classes of COCOMO variables? Give 1 example from each class.
21. What is the core assumption in COCOMO for lines of code and effort estimation?
