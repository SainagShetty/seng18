     - List two functional requirements
       For each, list factors that make them easier or harder to fill
5. Defend the following statements
   - Before building any software, it is wise to spend much time collecting details requirements docs.
   - Requirements engineering is a waste of time.
6. What are functional and non-functional requirements?

8. Defend the following statemetns
